??Question
Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, finally replacing Charlie's old broken wand.
Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand of high power and age.
Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power.
If more than one wand has same power, sort the result in order of descending age.

--solution
--ID,AGE,COINS_NEEDED,POWER OF WAND
--ORDER BY POWER DESC,AGE DES
--MIN GOLD REQUIRED TO BUY ALL NON EVIL WAND OF HIGH POWER AND AGE

WITH CTE1 AS
(
SELECT W.CODE,WP.AGE,W.MIN_COINS,W.POWER
FROM
(SELECT DISTINCT CODE,POWER,MIN(COINS_NEEDED) OVER(PARTITION BY CODE,POWER) AS MIN_COINS
FROM WANDS
 ) W
 JOIN 
 WANDS_PROPERTY WP
 ON W.CODE = WP.CODE
 WHERE WP.IS_EVIL = 0
    )
    
    SELECT A.ID,CTE1.AGE,CTE1.MIN_COINS,CTE1.POWER
    FROM CTE1
    JOIN WANDS A
    ON CTE1.CODE = A.CODE
    AND CTE1.MIN_COINS = A.COINS_NEEDED
    AND CTE1.POWER = A.POWER
    ORDER BY CTE1.POWER DESC, CTE1.AGE DESC;
