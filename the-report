??Question
Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. 
Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. 
The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. 
If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. 
Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. 
If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.

Write a query to help Eve.


--Query
--name, grade, mark
--grade < 8 , name not required
--grade, name desc order
--grade < 8, use 'NULL' as name
--for 1-7 grade use marks to order in desc
select case when g.grade >= 8 then s.name
            when g.grade < 8 then 'NULL'
            end,g.grade,s.marks 
from Students s
join Grades g
on s.marks between g.min_mark and g.max_mark
order by g.grade desc, s.name asc,s.marks asc;
