??Question
Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! 
Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and name of hackers who achieved full scores for more than one challenge. 
Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which the hacker earned a full score. 
If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending hacker_id.


--Solution
--HACKER_ID, NAME OUTPUT
--CONDITION FULL SCORE FOR MORE THAN ONE CHALLENGE
--ORDER DESC 'total no of chlng where hacker earned full score'
--same score for multiple hacker order by name in asc
with cte1 as
(
select s.hacker_id,s.challenge_id,s.score,
        c.difficulty_level,
        d.score as test
    from submissions s
join challenges c
on s.challenge_id = c.challenge_id
join difficulty d
on c.difficulty_level = d.difficulty_level
where s.score = d.score
),
cte2 as
(
select hacker_id,count(*) as cnt from cte1
group by hacker_id
having count(*) > 1
)
select c.hacker_id,h.name--,c.cnt
from cte2 c
join hackers h
on c.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
order by c.cnt desc , c.hacker_id asc--h.name asc
;
