Question?
You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!
The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. 
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. 
If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id.
Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

Query

with cte1 as
(
select hacker_id
        ,challenge_id
        ,max(score) as score
from Submissions   
group by hacker_id
        ,challenge_id
),
cte2 as
(select hacker_id
        --,challenge_id
        ,sum(score) as total_score
from cte1
group by hacker_id
        --,challenge_id
)

select cte2.hacker_id
        ,a.name
        ,cte2.total_score
from cte2
join Hackers a
on cte2.hacker_id = a.hacker_id
where cte2.total_score > 0
order by cte2.total_score desc
            ,cte2.hacker_id asc
